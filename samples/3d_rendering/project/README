## Details of the kernels for the 3d_rendering

kernel_1:   Original HCL generated kernel. No modifications.
kernel_2:   Packing pixels using struct
kernel_3:   Packing pixels usinf 2D-array
kernel_4:   Input data packing, pixel packing (using struct), using pragma UNROLL and IVDEP
kernel_5:   Input/output data packing, pixel packing (using struct), using pragma UNROLL and IVDEP
kernel_6:   Packing pixels using struct, using pragma IVDEP

3d_rendering.h            : Header file with struct definitions for packing.

main_3d_rendering.cpp:      host code for kernel that does not have any packing at the interface
main_pack_3d_rendering.cpp: host code for kernel that does have packing at the interface for input
main_pack2_3d_rendering.cpp: host code for kernel that does have packing at the interface for both input and output

## To run please execute the following command:
qsub -V -lselect=1:ncpus=64 -m abe -M debjit.pal@cornell.edu -q xeon ./build_1.sh
